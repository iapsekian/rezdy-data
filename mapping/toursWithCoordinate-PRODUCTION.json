The building is the previous building of Ratchaburi’s city hall with an inspiration from Western architectural style as appeared in its doors, windows, posts, corners and arches. It was built in 1922 in the reign of King Rama VI and was renovated by the Fine Arts Department to become the National Museum in 1988. It has been renovated for many times until in 1991 that the museum had an official opening ceremony presided by Princess Maha Chakri Sirindhorn. It is a museum exhibiting history and changes in each period of time of Ratchaburi province. It displays ancient artifacts, local culture of Ratchaburi, daily utensils and the ways of life of each group of people living in Ratchaburi; Lao Song, Karens and Tai-Yuan. It also features tourist destinations in Ratchaburi. We can say that the place gives both knowledge and entertainment Wat Maha That Worawihan Wat Maha That Worawihan is ancient temple, believed that this temple was built in the Dvaravati Period, around the 10th - 11th Century, nearly the same time as when the old city of Ratchaburi was built. The local people call</p><p>Wat Na Phrathat or Wat Phra Si Rattana Mahathat. There is a 12-wa stupa made from laterite. Inside was decorated with wall paintings. There are Buddha’s relics in the temple. Moreover, interesting things in the temple are Wihan Luang where Phra Mongkhon Buri is enshrined. It is a stucco Buddha image in the gesture of subduing Mara, which has a lap width of 8 Sok 1 Khuep. Its characteristic is of the Pre-Ayutthaya art, with a Sukhothai style face. It has a long body but short knees. He turns his face to the east, and there is another Buddha image behind his back, turning its face to the opposite side or the west. This means we ask the Buddha’s blessing to prevent danger from the front as well as the back. Thus, it is also called Phra Raksamueang-city’s protective Buddha-along the belief of people in the Ayutthaya era. In front of the Wihan, there is a boundary wall made of laterite.</p><p><b><br></b></p><p><b>DETAILS:</b></p><p><b>Style:&nbsp;</b>Sightseeing</p><p><b>Type:</b> Day Tour</p><p><b>Duration:</b> 1 Day</p><p><b>Starts in:</b> Hua Hin</p><p><b>Ends in:</b> Hua Hin</p><p><b>Suitable for:</b> All Ees</p><p><b><br></b></p><p><b>ITINERARY:</b></p><p>Meet with our guide at your hotel for a half discovering the ancient of Ratchaburi.</p><p>Arrived at Mahathat temple and spend approx 30 min inside the Temple.</p><p>after exploring the temple we lunch at a restaurant opposite the museum.

There are Buddha’s relics in the temple. Moreover, interesting things in the temple are Wihan Luang where Phra Mongkhon Buri is enshrined. It is a stucco Buddha image in the gesture of subduing Mara, which has a lap width of 8 Sok 1 Khuep. Its characteristic is of the Pre-Ayutthaya art, with a Sukhothai style face. It has a long body but short knees. He turns his face to the east, and there is another Buddha image behind his back, turning its face to the opposite side or the west. This means we ask the Buddha’s blessing to prevent danger from the front as well as the back. Thus, it is also called Phra Raksamueang-city’s protective Buddha-along the belief of people in the Ayutthaya era. In front of the Wihan, there is a boundary wall made of laterite.</p><p><b><br></b></p><p><b>DETAILS:</b></p><p><b>Style:&nbsp;</b>Sightseeing</p><p><b>Type:</b> Day Tour</p><p><b>Duration:</b> 1 Day</p><p><b>Starts in:</b> Hua Hin</p><p><b>Ends in:</b> Hua Hin</p><p><b>Suitable for:</b> All Ees</p><p><b><br></b></p><p><b>ITINERARY:</b></p><p>Meet with our guide at your hotel for a half discovering the ancient of Ratchaburi.</p><p>Arrived at Mahathat temple and spend approx 30 min inside the Temple.</p><p>after exploring the temple we lunch at a restaurant opposite the museum.

","description":"<p>Khao Hin Lek Fai well known as Flintstone Hill, the hill is located approximately 3 kilometers west of the town and is the best view point in Hua Hin. On Khao Hin Lek Fai provides a panoramic view of Hua Hin, the Royal Hua Hin Golf Course and the Gulf of Thailand. On the way to the hill you can visit some temples, but you should also know that the road to the top is very steep. Only very strong should try to make their way to the top on bike. Vehicle transport is recommended. The best time to see the city is in the early morning. Hua Hin popularity began to increase in the 1920 as the railway line from Bangkok was constructed and King Rama VI built Klai Kangwon Palace as a summer retreat. Hua Hin station is one of the oldest in Thailand and its main feature is The Royal Waiting Room that used to welcome King and his court when they were visiting the town. Originally, it was situated at Sanamchan Palace in Nakom Pathom and was known as Plub Pla Sanamchan. Eventually, the room was tranported to Hua Hin. It is designed in the same style as Maruekkhathayawan Palace and is an attraction not to be missed if you are staying in Hua Hin. The train station is located at the top (west end) of Damnoern Kasem Road. Enjoy the local food in night market. The market is a fascinating insight into Thailand and the way Thais like to live.

Vehicle transport is recommended. The best time to see the city is in the early morning. Hua Hin popularity began to increase in the 1920 as the railway line from Bangkok was constructed and King Rama VI built Klai Kangwon Palace as a summer retreat.

Originally, it was situated at Sanamchan Palace in Nakom Pathom and was known as Plub Pla Sanamchan. Eventually, the room was tranported to Hua Hin. It is designed in the same style as Maruekkhathayawan Palace and is an attraction not to be missed if you are staying in Hua Hin.

It was then reassembled by Allied Prisoners of War (POW) under Japanese supervision. The bridge was part of a strategic railway route to Myanmar in which the Japanese aimed to secure supplies with which to conquer other western Asian countries. It was 415 kilometres long (about 303 kilometres in Thailand and about 112 kilometres in Burma) and passed through the Three Pagoda Pass in Sangkhlaburi District, the northern most part of Kanchanaburi province. Construction started on September 16, 1942 at Nong Pladuk, and was completed on 25 December 1943. It is estimated that over 16,000 POWs from England, Australia, Holland and America died while building the bridge which was a target of bombing raids in 1945. In addition to this, approximate 90,000 labourers from Thailand, Myanmar, Malaysia and Indonesia died during its construction.</p><p><b><br></b></p><p><b>DETAILS:</b></p><p><b>Style:&nbsp;</b>Sightseeing</p><p><b>Type:</b> Day Tour</p><p><b>Duration:</b> 1 Day</p><p><b>Starts in:</b> Hua Hin</p><p><b>Ends in:</b> Hua Hin</p><p><b>Suitable for:</b> All Ees</p><p><b><br></b></p><p><b>ITINERARY:</b></p><p>Pick you up from your hotel in Hua Hin or Cha Am area for full day discovery in Kanchanaburi.</p><p>Upon arriving at kanchanaburi we set for lunch at Khrua Lun Pa San restaurant.</p><p>After Lunch we proceed to the Bridge of river Kwai for a sightseeing around the bridge.&nbsp;</p><p><span>After exploring the bridge we visit&nbsp; Art Gallery and War Museum.

","description":"<p>War Museum building at after the Japanese occupation of Thailand in World War II, the Japanese Imperial Army brought the iron bridge from Java. It was then reassembled by Allied Prisoners of War (POW) under Japanese supervision. The bridge was part of a strategic railway route to Myanmar in which the Japanese aimed to secure supplies with which to conquer other western Asian countries. It was 415 kilometres long (about 303 kilometres in Thailand and about 112 kilometres in Burma) and passed through the Three Pagoda Pass in Sangkhlaburi District, the northern most part of Kanchanaburi province. Construction started on September 16, 1942 at Nong Pladuk, and was completed on 25 December 1943. It is estimated that over 16,000 POWs from England, Australia, Holland and America died while building the bridge which was a target of bombing raids in 1945. In addition to this, approximate 90,000 labourers from Thailand, Myanmar, Malaysia and Indonesia died during its construction.</p><p><b><br></b></p><p><b>DETAILS:</b></p><p><b>Style:&nbsp;</b>Sightseeing</p><p><b>Type:</b> Day Tour</p><p><b>Duration:</b> 1 Day</p><p><b>Starts in:</b> Hua Hin</p><p><b>Ends in:</b> Hua Hin</p><p><b>Suitable for:</b> All Ees</p><p><b><br></b></p><p><b>ITINERARY:</b></p><p>Pick you up from your hotel in Hua Hin or Cha Am area for full day discovery in Kanchanaburi.</p><p>Upon arriving at kanchanaburi we set for lunch at Khrua Lun Pa San restaurant.</p><p>After Lunch we proceed to the Bridge of river Kwai for a sightseeing around the bridge.&nbsp;</p><p><span>After exploring the bridge we visit&nbsp; Art Gallery and War Museum.

Featuring a diverse topography, Ratchaburi features lowlands to the east and the Tanaosi Mountain Range to the west, which provides a natural border with Myanmar (Burma). The Ratchaburi provincial area abounds in natural attractions and historical sites. Ratchaburi features outstanding natural beauty and a number of opportunities to learn about Thai culture.
