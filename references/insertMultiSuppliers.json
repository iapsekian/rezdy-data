Tour managers/local English speaking Guide \r\nSoulful Concepts' reserves the right to operates certain destinations with a ‘tour manager’. This is specified in the inclusions section of each destination itinerary. Other destinations will operate with a ‘local English speaking Guide’ only. In this condition, ‘tour manager’ includes both the nominated tour manager and any other nominated person given at any time the task of leading or supervising any aspect of the tour. Soulful Concepts' tour managers and local English speaking guides take their responsibilities seriously and if for any reason a Soulful Concepts representative believes, in his or her absolute discretion, that you should not participate in the tour, before your departure, even if you pass your medical, he/she may exclude you from the tour. In this event, but subject to condition 5, you will be offered the option of taking another tour considered suitable for you or a full refund when only the travel deposit is paid. After full payment you will not be entitled to a refund. If for any reason during a tour the tour manager or local English Speaking Guide considers you should not participate further due to you committing an illegal act, or in the opinion of the nominated tour manager, your behaviour is causing or is likely to cause danger, distress or annoyance to others, or your fitness or health is inadequate, he/she may direct you not to continue and you will follow the nominated instructions. In this case you will not be entitled to any refund. Travel insurance may compensate you depending on the circumstances. Soulful Concepts reserves the right to change, at any time, the tour manager of any tour. If this happens, Soulful Concepts will try to ensure that the alternative tour manager has expertise commensurate with that of the original tour manager. Any such change by Soulful Concepts will not give rise to any right on your part to cancel the tour or claim any expenses, loss or damage which may be suffered. A ‘tour manager’ may accompany a group with 7 or more travellers up to a maximum of 16 travellers. A group size of 6 or less travellers will operate with a local English speaking guide only.\r\n8. Solo Travellers\r\nSoulful Concepts offers solo travellers an option to avoid paying the single supplement by nominating to elect to travel on a ‘willing to share’ room basis. If Soulful Concepts is unable to match you with another ‘willing to share’ traveller of the same sex, Soulful Concepts will confirm a single room at the twin share price. If you require a guaranteed single room you must book and pay the single supplement price. Soulful Concepts will match travellers of the same sex and endeavour to match you with a companion of a similar age, however, this is not guaranteed. The ‘Willing to share’ option is not available for travellers under the age of 18. Soulful Concepts requires a minimum of 5 travellers on a departure to confirm ‘willing to share’. The willing to share’ option is subject to request when bookings are received within 55 days of scheduled departure date. Once a ‘willing to share’ option is confirmed, full amendment or cancellation fees will apply if the booking is changed to a single supplement within 65 days prior to departure.\r\n9. Cancellation due to tour booking numbers \r\nSoulful Concepts reserves the right to cancel any tour prior to departure in the event that there are too few people booked on a tour in which case you will be given a full refund of the tour price paid by you.

Soulful Concepts also reserves, in its absolute discretion, the right to cancel any tour due to any government travel warning or advice, or any change in such warning or advice. In this event, condition 4 applies as if you had transferred or cancelled the tour at the date that Soulful Concepts cancelled the tour. Travel insurance may compensate you depending on the circumstances. \r\n11. Itineraries and brochures \r\nItineraries and other details are published in good faith as statements of intention only and reasonable changes in the itinerary and related items may be made where deemed necessary or advisable by Soulful Concepts.

Proof of citizenship or information required to travel \r\nIt is your responsibility to obtain proper identification or proof of citizenship as required by the authorities of the destination to which you are travelling. You will not be entitled to a refund if you are denied boarding or entry on any basis, including without limitation, improper documentation or failure to provide information.

In the event that an airline’s proposed travel or fare schedule is amended or cancelled, such amendment or cancellation will not be considered a cancellation of the tour by Soulful Concepts. Any flights or other transport forming part of the tour arrangements are subject to the conditions of the carrying airline or other transport entity, which in most cases limits the airlines’ or other transport entity’s liability to passengers in accordance with applicable international law and conventions. \r\n15. Tour prices \r\nTour prices are per person based on ground costs, fuel prices, airfares, exchange rates and assumptions made at the time of printing the brochure.
