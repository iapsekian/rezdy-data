This is not a jump time. Failure to turn up at the assigned checkin time may result in delays to your jump. You will need to checkin and complete paperwork and briefings prior to your jump so it is important that you arrive and checkin on time.\r\n\r\nBookings are non-refundable however you may change your booking date or checkin time with 24hrs prior notice. Should weather prevent your jump from proceeding all payments remain valid for a period of 12 months from original booking date and you are free to choose an alternative date. There are no refunds due weather unless you paid for booking insurance at the time of the original booking. Booking insurance is only available at the time of booking and may not be added at a later date.\r\n\r\nLess that 24hours prior notice will result in a $25 re booking fee being charged.\r\n\r\nIf you think you may be unable to choose alternative dates or have limited availability or are traveling we strongly advise you choose booking insurance. Booking insurance is $19 per person which must be paid at the time of booking and allows you to receive a full refund. Not including the $19 insurance and not including any merchant fees.\r\n\r\nBooking insurance will protect you should you be unable to jump due to weather and not be able to rebook to another date or transfer your booking to another of our skydive locations. It also covers you for accidents, sickness and breakdowns on the day of your skydive as long as you notify us prior to your checkin time on the day of your jump allowing you to re book to another date or receive a full refund less the pre paid booking insurance fee of $19 per person.\r\n\r\nAt the time of booking all validity of packages, prices and offers must be confirmed by the customer booking the skydive. We reserve the right to refuse expired, invalid or unconfirmed offers or packages.\r\n\r\nTo change your booking we require 24 hours notice. We require a $100 deposit per person prior to the booking date. Deposits are a per person payment payment and may not be used to pay the balance of another persons skydive. Deposits are transferable to another person to pay their deposit and remain valid for 12 months.\r\n\r\nThere are no refunds without booking insurance. Booking insurance does not cover persons, or members of a group, failing to turn up on the day of their booking without giving prior notice.\r\n\r\nCredit Card Payments. A 1.8% credit card surcharge may apply. Where this takes place customers will be advised prior to making payment and given the choice of alternate payment methods. In extraordinary circumstances where a refund does take place without booking insurance a $40 administrational fee per person will be charged.\r\n\r\nSafety is a large consideration when skydiving, factors such as wind, cloud, rain, and other factors such as air traffic can affect the time it takes to complete your skydive activity. Weather can change for better or worse in minutes. Whilst we endeavor to complete an individual’s jump within 2-3 hours of arrival, we advise you to arrive with no time constraints – you should plan for this to be at least a half- day’s activity.\r\n\r\nAircraft are mechanical and periodically require servicing and maintenance; we reserve the right to change aircraft type without notice. On occasion, these aircraft changes, weather , Air Traffic Control (ATC) and other operational considerations may require us to change our operational altitude without notice.\r\n\r\nAny unplanned Aircraft availability or other unexpected circumstances beyond our control preventing jumps proceeding: Bookings may be changed to any other date within 12 months of the original booking date. Any refund request due to jumps not proceeding and customers being unable to choose alternative dates requires booking insurance.\r\n\r\nMedical conditions or any other considerations that may affect your skydive should be discussed with us prior to your booking. No alcohol / recreational drugs or medication that may affect or impair your judgment are to be taken.\r\n\r\nGift Vouchers are non-refundable but are transferable. Vouchers will expire 12 months after purchase. Failure to checkin on your chosen date and time will render your voucher invalid.\r\n\r\nExtending a Gift Voucher expiry date:\r\n\r\nWe understand that things do pop up, or time can pass you by. If you forget to redeem your voucher there are some options to extend the value of your voucher.\r\n\r\nNot Expired - Extension Required\r\n\r\nIf your voucher hasn't expired, we can extend your voucher for an additional 3 months for an administration fee of $50. An extension can only be made once.\r\n\r\nVoucher Expired - within 30 days of expiry\r\n\r\nIf your voucher has been expired for 30 days or less we can reactivate your voucher for a fee of $50 this will extend your gift voucher for 30 days.\r\n\r\n\r\nVoucher Expired - 31 days or more past expiry\r\n\r\nIf your voucher has been expired for 31 days or more the voucher cannot be extended under any circumstances.\r\n\r\nBooking a Gift Voucher. You need to redeem your Gift Voucher PRIOR to the jump day by calling and letting us know your voucher number, otherwise you will be unable to use the voucher on the day of your jump.\r\n\r\nIf you lose or misplace your voucher you can still redeem the voucher by quoting your voucher number when booking. To physically replace a lost or misplaced voucher is $25 inc express postage.\r\n\r\nYou must safeguard your voucher number; we will honor or redeem any voucher if a valid (unused) voucher number is quoted.\r\n\r\nWeight is an important factor in Aviation and Skydiving. It affects aircraft weight and balance , fuel allowances and climb rates.\r\n\r\nWeight is also an important factor on a Tandem jump. It affects equipment maintenance, your instructors workload and manufacturers limits and specifications on equipment.\r\n\r\nPlease note that MAXIMUM weight for a Tandem skydive is 110kg All passengers over 95kg a surcharge will apply as follows:\r\n\r\n95kg and over $25\r\n100kg and over $50\r\n\r\n* 110kg and over $100\r\n* Any marginal weight over 110kg where we assess the weight to be acceptable.\r\n\r\nMinimum age is 12 years old and all minors must have a legal guardian present on the day of the jump.\r\n\r\nWhilst it is not mandatory to book a video, it is advisable, as on some occasions a late change of mind may result in disappointment.\r\n\r\nAll bookings require a $100 deposit per person paid at the time of booking to secure your checkin time. If due to weather or after your arrival you are unable to complete your skydive your booking remains valid for 12 months from the original booking date and you may select another date. Deposits may not be used to pay the balance of another persons skydive. Deposits are transferable to pay another persons deposit.\r\n\r\nVideo and photo charges:\r\n\r\nIf all footage is unavailable due to camera failure or other unforeseen circumstances you will be offered a second skydive on the same day with camera AT NO CHARGE, or a full refund of your video/photo product payment.","extras":[{"name":"Photos Only","description":"Capture all the action and receive up to 150-250 still photos of your skydive.

There are many tour companies visiting this iconic region but we offer some very important points of difference:</h4><br><ul><li>We guarantee a small group of only 11 travellers in a comfortable minibus.</li></ul><ul><li>We have a very low price for a truly small group tour, not a 24 person \"small group tour\". </li></ul><ul><li>We include all the Great Ocean Road highlights, including some that are missed on other tours. </li></ul><ul><li>Dinner is included with options for all tastes and requirements. A lunch break is also included in a small town with lots of options to buy your own. Or you can bring something with you to save time and money.</li></ul><ul><li>We depart at 9.30am (8.30am in winter). This means a later evening finish but this also means we travel BEHIND all the other tour buses, not WITH them! It also allows a leisurely breakfast and plenty of time to meet us at our central pickup point - no time is wasted picking up everyone at their individual hotels.&nbsp; </li></ul><b>Here is just some of what is included, the journey itself is also a highlight!<br></b><ul><li><b>Our first stop on the Great Ocean Road is the seaside town of Anglesea. Enjoy a free morning tea on the beach. </b></li><li><b>We continue this iconic road trip with stunning ocean views, photo opportunities and a stop at the Memorial Arch.</b></li><li><b>At Lorne we enjoy the views from Teddys Lookout, missed by the big tour buses.</b></li><li><b>More classic Great Ocean Road views and photo stops follow before a short walk at Kennett River to see the wild koalas and colourful parrots living there.</b></li><li><b>Lunch! We stop in Apollo Bay, a charming seaside town. It will be a late lunch break so bring some snacks if you are having an early breakfast. There's plenty of time to buy lunch from a variety of cafes and shops and enjoy an ice cream and a wander along the beach. Maybe even a quick swim in the chilly Southern Ocean?!</b></li><li><b>We then follow the road through the Otway National Park and include a short rainforest walk. </b></li><li><b>Look for wild kangaroos at our secret roo viewing spot.

There are severaldiving points that worth to explore Blue lagoon, Padang Bay channel, Tanjung Bungsil&nbsp;(Bias Putih), and Jepun.<p><strong><br></strong></p><p><strong>Blue Lagoon</strong><br></p><p>This lagoon is just north of Tanjung Silayukti, takes 6 minutes to get here by outrigger fishing boat with the outboard vessel or even shorter by speed boat from Padang bay. Actually this is a very small bay, in the bay grows dense sea grasses and boulder rocks covered with soft corals and Hydroids, the reef extends towards Turtle’s Neck (Baong Penyu). It is steep slope reef exposed to the channel, table shaped coral and a variety of Crinoids major structure of the slope. At the hook of the slope stands hard Dome corals at 15 meters, with its huge floppy sponges, swarm number of cleaning Shrimps, Black frogfishes, Leaf scorpion fishes and others unusual animals. The reef runs toward Tanjung Silayukti, lying at 10 meters gradually down the sandy slope at&nbsp;15 meters. The drab bottom with scattered rocks descend down the sloping to about 18 meters, there sits dome hard corals where the unusual animals like variety of Scorpion fishes, and Crocodile fishes are commonly encountered. The scattered rocks and boulder rocks in the bay make an interesting colourful reef&nbsp;with variety of prolific fishes. The surge sometime is quite strong pushing toward the bay into the shallow reef and it easily causes disorientation. The water temperature is damn cold sometimes and it has ever reached 18 degrees C, good to wear long exposure suit to dive here.</p><p><strong>Jepun</strong><br></p><p> Its location is about 50 meters offshore, where stands a small temple at the rocky cliff on the coastline, this&nbsp;temple is -Pura Jepun-. Jepun stands for Frangipani flower in Balinese language. The descending reef is started up current offshore from where the temple sits, first 2 to 3 meters reef then continues a wide sloping terrace falling off significantly where giant Anemones, Crinoids of varying colour and many other reef fishes. Chevron Barracuda, Pencil thin-keeled Needlefish are common here. While drift diving you will end up finding the rockier reef wall before Blue Lagoon. It is better put ourselves at the shallow outcrop to see a swarm of reef fish. If big waves occur the bottom will swirl up, makes the visibility a bit of a blur, better shift the diving to another reef. The water temperature is rather cold (roughly 24 degrees C) due the thermocline that often occurs.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Tanjung Bungsil</strong><br></p><p>A small outboard motor boat cruises south side of Padang Bai harbour about 15 minutes to pass the peninsula&nbsp;south of the harbour, the boat will anchor to get the divers prepared dive gear, don them and hit the water. Descending to the slope bottom up to 20 meters spur into the bay, soft corals, rocky boulders shaped covering with coral reef are rich with sea life, Reef sharks often spotted. By the end of the dive, when you surface watching out the ferry passing into the bay, if the sound of it is heard better delay a moment before a direct ascent, because it’s hard to determine the ferry’s position underwater. Best time to dive at this location is if the current flows into the bay or on the slack high tide. Water temperature is relative warm and sometimes-even drop as to 25 degrees C.</p><p><b>Padang Bai Channel</b><br></p><p>To dive here we start descending from the buoy close to the ferry dock; the channel runs further east to the hook of Tanjung Silayukti. At the beginning of the dive the reef is not interesting, much more interesting around the hook of Tanjung Silayukti with scattered boulder rocks, bommies, colourful hard corals, soft corals, number of Crinoids and a variety of tropical reef fishes. Turtles are frequently seen on this steeply slope reef that runs to 30 meters deep, the current is sometimes unpredictable changing its strength and direction that pushes into deep water. Don’t let us sucked into blue water and always ascend safely from the shallow reef of Tanjung Silayukti so the boat skipper can easily provide the pick up service by the end of the diving. Water temperature&nbsp;is frequently fallen roughly 26 degrees C.</p><p><i><br></i></p><p><i>A Minimum of two divers are required to run this dive trip.
